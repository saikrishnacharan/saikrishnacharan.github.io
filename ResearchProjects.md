### IoT for air pollution monitoring
- Used Python Machine Learning Libraries are Seaborn and Pandas 
- To implement and deploy an IoT network of air pollution monitoring nodes, constituting of various sensors to measure the air quality parameters such as Particulate matter (PM2.5,PM10), Carbon Monoxide(CO), NOX, temperature, humidity, SO2, NH3, which are required for calculating the AQI index according to the Indian AQI guidelines. 
- This IoT network will be deployed in IIIT campus and adjoining regions. The sensor node network is connected to internet using different communication technologies such as WiFi, LoRaWAN, 2G/3G/4G technologies. Data analysis is done on the collected data and data is displayed on the dashboard.
- I analyzed data collected by pollution monitoring nodes deployed in IIIT campus, using machine learning techniques such as Parallel coordinates, Pair-wise correlation matrix, Correlation heatmap, Joint plots and other Spatial interpolation techniques
