* Early spatial filters were designed to form pencil beams in order to receive signal from a specific location and attenuate signals from other directions.
* Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception.


* Now let us consider a Uniform Linear Array
