Interactive C Shell
-----
- <span style="color:green;">Course: - </span> *Operating Systems*
* Developed a user-interactive shell in C, implementing the major features of GNU/Linux shell like piping, redirecting, handling background and foreground processes
  - [Link to project details](https://github.com/saikrishnacharan/Interactive-Shell)

File Sharing Protocol between client and server
-----
- <span style="color:green;">Course: -</span> *Communication Networks*
* File sharing protocol is created between client and server using socket programming which had functionalities like Indexed searching, File Hashing (using MD5 checksum), File transfer (UDP and TCP) and caching.

Style Transfer for Headshot Portraits
-----
- <span style="color:green;">Course: - </span>*Digital Image Processing*
* Headshot portraits are a popular subject in photography but to achieve a compelling visual style requires advanced skills that a casual photographer will not have. 
* Presented a technique to transfer the style of an example head-shot photo onto a new one. This can allow one to easily reproduce the look of renowned artists. At the core of our approach is a new multiscale technique to robustly transfer the local statistics of an example portrait onto a new one. This technique matches properties such as the local contrast and the overall lighting direction while being tolerant to the unavoidable differences between the faces of two different people.

* Our proposed method output looks like:-

Face Classification 
-----
- <span style="color:green;">Course: -</span>  *Statistical Methods in AI*
* Performed data reduction techniques like K-PCA, LDA and build classifers using Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) and Support Vector Machines(SVM) on popular datasets for distinguishing image classes.

Multi Dimensional Divide and Conquer
-----
- <span style="color:green;">Course: -</span>  *Operating Systems*
* Used this paradigm to solve domination and closest point problems in k-dimensional space and performed complexity analysis.
