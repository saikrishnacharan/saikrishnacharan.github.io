Style Transfer for Headshot Portraits
-----
- <span style="color:green;">Course: - </span>*Digital Image Processing*
* Headshot portraits are a popular subject in photography but to achieve a compelling visual style requires advanced skills that a casual photographer will not have. 
* Presented a technique to transfer the style of an example head-shot photo onto a new one. This can allow one to easily reproduce the look of renowned artists. At the core of our approach is a new multiscale technique to robustly transfer the local statistics of an example portrait onto a new one. This technique matches properties such as the local contrast and the overall lighting direction while being tolerant to the unavoidable differences between the faces of two different people.

* Our proposed method output looks like:-
