Interactive C Shell
-----

* Developed a user-interactive shell in C, implementing the major features of GNU/Linux shell like piping, redirecting, handling background and foreground processes

File Sharing Protocol between client and server
-----

* File sharing protocol is created between client and server using socket programming which had functionalities like Indexed searching, File Hashing (using MD5 checksum), File transfer (UDP and TCP) and caching.

Style Transfer for Headshot Portraits
-----

* Headshot portraits are a popular subject in photography but to achieve a compelling visual style requires advanced skills that a casual photographer will not have. 
* Presented a technique to transfer the style of an example head-shot photo onto a new one. This can allow one to easily reproduce the look of renowned artists. At the core of our approach is a new multiscale technique to robustly transfer the local statistics of an example portrait onto a new one. This technique matches properties such as the local contrast and the overall lighting direction while being tolerant to the unavoidable differences between the faces of two different people.
